Mojavi Core 2.0

Mojavi version 2 (PHP4). Mojavi is a fantastically lightweight, simple, and easy-to-use MVC framework for PHP. It's no longer up-to-date, but I leave it here in case anyone finds it of use. See the Mojavi(mojavi.org) site for more recent info, and if you want a complete application framework, I'd recommend Symfony, which is based on Mojavi.

Thank You.
