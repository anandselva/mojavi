                        Mojavi CHANGELOG for 2.0.3b
                  ------------------------------------


----- BUG FIXES ----------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed "incorrect" reference passing for PHP 4.4.0 compatibility.

- Fixed a bug in the Error Logging system, where fatals were recorded as warnings, and warnings as fatals
http://forum.mojavi.org/index.php?showtopic=1119
- Fixed a bug in the controller that would cause a custom session container to be overwritten by the default.
http://forum.mojavi.org/index.php?showtopic=1191
- Fixed a bug in the ValidatorManager that prevented multi-value objects (arrays) from being validated at all, and possibly throwing an error.

----- NOTABLE MODIFICATIONS ----------------------------------------------------

- Views now have an optional initialize(&$controller,&$request,&$user) method.  This method can be used to perform common commands before a View is executed.  The designed use for this is to increase flexibility and re-usability by making the abstraction of a View easier, and cleaner. 

----- DIRECTORY STRUCTURE ------------------------------------------------------
